				<!---<span>Gryffindor</span> is one of the four <span>Houses</span> of <span>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</span> and was founded by <span>Godric Gryffindor</span>. Gryffindor instructed the <span>Sorting Hat</span> to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. Sir <span>Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington</span>, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the House ghost.

				<span>Gryffindor</span> corresponds roughly to the element of <span>fire</span>, and it is for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.--->
